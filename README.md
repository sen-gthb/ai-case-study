M1 AI Case Study
# **KONGSBERG GRUPPEN / KONGSBERG MARITIME**
> *Extreme Performance for Extreme Conditions*

## Overview and Origin
* Name of company?
Kongsberg Gruppen is a Norwegian group-enterprise that develops advanced technology, claiming to place sustainability and the resolution of climate change at the core of all of its work. [1]

* When was the company incorporated?
Kongsberg was founded March 20, 1814. They went public in 1993, however are mostly owned by the Norwegian government. [2] 

* Who are the founders of the company?
Poul Steenstrup [2] founded the company, which was originally called Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk (Kongsberg Arms Factory)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Kongsberg initially manufactured rifles for the Norwegian military, showing their early prowess for technological innovation in the late 1800s with advancements in rifle technology. They began branching out into other sectors in 1918 and continued to expand into domains of advanced technology and manufacturing through the 1970s, when they began to establish themselves as innovators in maritime and oil/gas through their work in dynamic positioning (DP) and subsea installations. Today, Kongsberg applies their advanced technologies in domains that entail "extreme conditions," from sea to space. [2, 3] The Kongsberg Gruppen is currently comprised of 3 main groups: Kongsberg Maritime [4], Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace [5], and Kongsberg Digital [6]. Each group is leveraging AI in many ways, however currently its maritime branch accounts 80% of its overall operations, so for this case study I will focus on Kongsberg Maritime (KM), particularly their DP solution. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
KM's primary sources of revenue come from operations, contracts, and research & development. According to KM's 2022 annual report, the maritime group had a yearly total revenue of MNOK 18,978 [7]

### Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The primary objective of KM is to leverage innovation and advanced technologies in maritime operations while 1) mitigating climate change by reducing carbon emissions, and 2) improving safety.  One primary example is their aforementioned DP solution, which enables ships to remain in position by relying on engine and propellor power rather than an anchor. [8] KM's DP was first launched in 1975 but has continued to be innovated to now where it integrates AI to leverage the above mentioned data towards real time decision-making and autonomous adjustments to maintain vessel station, even in very challenging sea conditions. [4]

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
KM products and services span across passenger, offshore energy, merchant, and special purpose industries of maritime, and they claim their products are operating on more than 30,000 vessels worldwide. [4] Just the global DP system market alone, which was valued at $5.6 billion in 2020, is anticipated to grow to $17.6 billion within the decade. [9] 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
DP technology in general has enabled big leaps in the safety and range of offshore operations (which can consist of activities such as research, offshore drilling and renewable energy installations, passenger and shipping transport, etc.) by improving maneuverability of ships and enabling navigation to deeper waters that are too deep or too congested either above or below waters for anchors to be able to be used.  At the same time, traditional DP systems consume a great deal resources such as fuel, training, and maintenance costs. [9]
While many companies offer DP solutions, KM's are superior in that they have maximized resource efficiency into their current technology, [10] and is even backing the Paris Agreement's initiative to become carbon neutral by 2050. [7] While the other companies do claim to optimize fuel efficiency in their DP solutions, none have gone so far as to place these objective squarely at the center of their organizational objectives the way KM has, and none appear to have enabled as much efficiency into their technology (though I was not able to find actual numbers to compare). This lagging and lack of foresight by other leading DP manufacturers may ultimately lead to substantial future market loss.  

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
The AI analytics that they use in their DP congregate data from weather and sea conditions, navigation feedback, sensors, and vessel performance metrics to optimize safety and efficiency. [4] Further specifics were not available. 


#### Landscape

* What field is the company in?
As mentioned above, Kongsberg Gruppe is working in the sectors of maritime, defense/aerospace, oil/gas and digitalization [1]. While these sectors seem a bit paradoxical (coupling sustainability technology with weapons manufacturing?), this company provides a powerful example of AI's vast potential constructiveness and destructiveness all in one organization. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
Enormous advancements have been made in the past 10 years in the maritime industry in sensors, navigation systems, using virtual reality for training simulations, the application of machine learning, system integration, and the development of remote and autonomous operations. [4]

* What are the other major companies in this field?
Aside from KM who leads DP solution implementation, Wärtsilä, Marine Technologies LLC, and Navis Engineering are some of the other top manufacturers of DP systems worldwide. [11] However there are currently several additional DP providers globally. [9]


##### Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
KM operates in 34 countries, and employed 6,583 people at the end of Q3 2023. [12]

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
Some of the core metrics in the maritime industry include financial (revenue, ROI, and order backlog, etc.), innovation (research & development), and operational metrics (quality of services and safety). In addition, some companies also track environmental and sustainability metrics (emissions and advancement of green technologies).

Some KM 2022 Annual Report metrics are:  [7]
1. KM revenue grew 14.97% (from MNOK 16,507 in 2021 to 18,878 in 2022)
2. Order backlog increased 43.95% (from MNOK 12,960 in 2021 to 18,641 in 2022)
3. Improved maritime safety through 34.43% increase in sales in their sensors & robotics portfolio which offers mapping and monitoring solutions. (MNOK 3,050 in 2021 to to 4,100 in 2022)
4. Emissions of in-house carbon decreased by 3%.
5. In addition, KM was awarded the prestigious Autonomous Shipping Award at the 2023 SMART4SEA EUROPORT Awards for their technological advancements in autonomous shipping. [13]


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
Just looking at % growth in net sales and revenue, in 2022, Wärtsilä saw net sales increase by 22% to EUR 5,735M and order intake increased 6% to EUR 6,074M, however operations saw a -0.4% decline in revenue to EUR -26M. [14];  Marine Technologies saw revenue increase from 109.23% from USD 3,513,788 in 2021 to 7,350,946 in 2022. [15]; Navis' revenue was USD 8.5M in 2022, however 2021 comparison data was not found, nor were any full annual reports published. This may be due to Finnish regulations (it is a Finnish company), or it may be small enough to avoid regulatory requirements to publish this data. [16] We can see that the general trend across maritime industry is quickly growing, including KM. 

###### Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
KM has expressed strong interest in "future proofing" through sustainability initiatives through alternative fuels and renewable energies, however developing renewables and moving towards carbon neurtrality demands the investment a great deal of capital and resources. [17] They have therefore focused most of their innovation developments around increasing efficiency with technologies that still rely upon petroleum products and other non-renewable resources. This is definitely good to a point, but despite the costs I would advise them to invest extremely aggressively in the development of carbon-neutral solutions now to power their advanced technologies. Developing AI produces an astounding amount of carbon when powered by non-renewable resources [20], and integrating renewables would profoundly hasten the achievement of going carbon neutral by 2050. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Given the substantial predicted growth of the maritime industry during the next decade, this would likely lead to longterm market stability, create a strong competitive advantage over their competitors, and ultimately enable more opportunities for innovation and "future proofing" than if they continue to rely upon nonrenewable resources, as many of their competitors seem to be doing. Plus, [it just wouldn't be smart not to.] (

 [18] 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
They could either leverage existing renewable technologies such as solar photovoltaic systems, offshore wind turbines, hydropower systems, or batteries, or invest in the development of ocean energy, which is an emerging technology that has yet to be fully operationalized but aims to convert energy from ocean water movement into electricity. [19]


* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
They offer a range of possible solutions that could be used depending on the domain of their operations, given that KM works across all sectors of maritime - passenger, offshore energy, merchant, and special purpose industries.
